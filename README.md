# cip-votingmap
Re-building the city's voting map app based on the Community Innovation Proposal released in July 2019.

# From the CiP Document
`Improving voter access and awareness during 2020 election: Burlington is a unique community â€“ especially in its electoral districting. The City has eight wards, and residents vote at a polling station within their ward for every level of election (City, State, Federal). However, the State legislative districts do not correspond to the ward boundaries. A single ward could have several legislative districts cutting across it, so your neighbor may vote for the same City candidates but different State legislative candidates.`

`The City has an existing electoral map that is available at polling stations and online (as a shapefile, https://www2.burlingtonvt.gov/Clerk/Elections/Map/), and would like to improve voter access by making this information about what ward and legislative district a voter lives in available in an easy to use mobile app or webbased application. The idea would be to allow both voting residents as well as election workers assisting voters at the polls quickly and easily determine the correct ballot to give a citizen.`
